          I am currently pursuing an Ontario College Diploma in Software Development at Seneca Polytechnic College, where I am gaining a strong foundation in programming languages and relevant coursework such as  
           Web Programming for Apps and Services, IT Project Management, and Advanced Database Services. My coursework includes proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, MongoDB, and Node.js.
In my current role as an IT Support Technician at TJ Bloc Pilates, I have honed my technical skills by providing prompt and efficient technical support to employees. I have also played a key role in the installation, configuration, and maintenance of computer systems, ensuring seamless operations within the organization. Moreover, I have conducted user training sessions on various technology and software applications, including Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve, to enhance user proficiency.
Additionally, my experience as a Social Media Manager at TJ Bloc Pilates has equipped me with valuable skills in developing and implementing effective social media strategies. I successfully increased the companies social media following by devising engaging content and managing various social media accounts, such as Instagram. My ability to analyze social media data and user engagement has enabled me to make data-driven decisions for content optimization, ultimately contributing to the companies online presence and brand image.
